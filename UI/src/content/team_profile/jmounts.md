My marketing journey started in high school, winning a statewide Marketing Management competition. I cut my teeth in Guangzhou, China -- launching social ads, standing up a CRM, and booking international meetings through cold outreach.  <br><br> Iâ€™ve since shipped frontend for **Taco Bell**, **Tim Hortons**, **Disney**, and **Miami Design District**.  I also run **Debatetrack**, an education company with years of 50%+ email open rates and the #1 in-niche Youtube channel. <br><br> My greatest joy comes from delivering out-sized marketing results to clients.
